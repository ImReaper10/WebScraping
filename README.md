# WebScraping
Built a project that scrapes data from a Wikipedia page about the largest U.S. companies using "requests" and "Beautiful Soup". The scraped data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, with an option to export it as a CSV. The project handles multiple tables and focuses on efficient data extraction and troubleshooting.
